<p>The span and div elements are both generic container elements in HTML. However, they have different display properties.</p>

<p>The span element is an inline element, which means that it flows with the surrounding text. The div element is a block-level element, which means that it starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its container.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how to use the span and div elements:</p>

```html
<span style="color: red;">This is a span element.</span>
<div style="background-color: blue;">This is a div element.</div>


<p>In this example, the span element will be displayed in red and will flow with the surrounding text. The div element will be displayed in blue and will start on a new line and take up the full width of the page.</p>

<p>Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between span and div elements:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>span</th>
      <th>div</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Display</td>
      <td>Inline</td>
      <td>Block</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Newline</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Width</td>
      <td>Content-width</td>
      <td>Container-width</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>When to use span and div elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the span element to group inline elements, such as text or links.</li>
  <li>Use the div element to group block-level elements, such as headings, paragraphs, or images.</li>
</ul>
